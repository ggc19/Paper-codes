# Research data and model guidance for the article
Some or all data, models, or codes that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. Here, we present the main model codes.

The file named 'TFCNN.py' is the time frequency convolutional neural network model
The file named 'FCNN.py' is the frequency convolutional neural network model
The file named 'TCNN.py' is the time convolutional neural network model
The file named 'Classification models.py' is the machine learing models used for comparison
The file 'Feature extraction.m' is the time-frequency spectrogram and the traditional signal features. 

The convolutional neural networks are implemented by keras tool and the backend is tensorflow. Other classification models are implemented by scikit-learn tool and some python packages. Run them in Anaconda3 (Spyder) platform. The signal processing methods are implemented by matlab R2014a.
